# Ghoul Engine
*3D Renderering Engine created from various sources in order to advance in 3D rendering. An ongoing project, this will reflect my expanding knowledge in graphics programming.*

The primary languages used in this project are C, C++, and GLSL. There are plans to embed Python at a later date for some basic scripting.

### Features::
- 2D Rendering
- 3D Rendering (currently)
- Physically Based Rendering (planned)
- ECS system (planned)
- Basic Raytracing (planned)

### Resources used::
- LearnOpenGL.com
- ViktorGordon OpenGL on YouTube
- OGLDEV on YouTube
- The Cherno OpenGL series

### Libraries Used::
- GLFW
- GLAD
- My own Primitive Library
- My own Math library
    
*This project is the bulk of my gap in resume.
