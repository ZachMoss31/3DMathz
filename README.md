# OpenGL Renderer
3D Renderer created from various sources in order to learn the basics of 3D and rendering. This renderer is an ongoing project, and will reflect my expanding knowledge in graphics programming. 

The primary languages used in this project are C, C++, and GLSL. There are plans to embed Python at a later date for some basic scripting.

Features::
    - 2D Rendering
    - 3D Rendering (currently)
    - Physically Based Rendering (planned)
    - ECS system (planned)
    - Basic Raytracing (planned)

Resources used::
    - LearnOpenGL.com
    - ViktorGordon OpenGL on YouTube
    - OGLDEV on YouTube
    - The Cherno OpenGL series

Libraries Used::
    - GLFW
    - GLAD
    - My own Primitive Library
    - My own Math library
    
*This project is the bulk of my gap in resume.
